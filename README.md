# Photoshop Event Backend

A Flask-based backend for the Photoshop event app, powering the management of participant uploads, judge scoring, and leaderboard generation. This API handles file uploads of artistic works, stores scores assigned by judges, and provides endpoints to compute and serve leaderboard data for the React.js frontend. Built with Flask and Python, it uses a database (e.g., SQLite) to persist data and ensures secure, efficient processing. To set up, clone the repo, install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and run `python app.py` to start the server.
